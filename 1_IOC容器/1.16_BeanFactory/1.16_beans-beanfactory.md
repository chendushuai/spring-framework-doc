# 1.16. The BeanFactory

The BeanFactory API provides the underlying basis for Spring’s IoC functionality. Its specific contracts are mostly used in integration with other parts of Spring and related third-party frameworks, and its DefaultListableBeanFactory implementation is a key delegate within the higher-level GenericApplicationContext container.

BeanFactory and related interfaces (such as BeanFactoryAware, InitializingBean, DisposableBean) are important integration points for other framework components. By not requiring any annotations or even reflection, they allow for very efficient interaction between the container and its components. Application-level beans may use the same callback interfaces but typically prefer declarative dependency injection instead, either through annotations or through programmatic configuration.

Note that the core BeanFactory API level and its DefaultListableBeanFactory implementation do not make assumptions about the configuration format or any component annotations to be used. All of these flavors come in through extensions (such as XmlBeanDefinitionReader and AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor) and operate on shared BeanDefinition objects as a core metadata representation. This is the essence of what makes Spring’s container so flexible and extensible.
